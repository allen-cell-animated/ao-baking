1. Open C4D
2. In UV-editing mode select 'UV Mesh' and then 'Show UV Mesh' (we tried to script this, but it doesnt seem to work)
3. Go back to standard/startup view if you want to watch the console. 
4. Run script 'visual-cell.py'

## Editing the script 
Things you'll need to change:
* Input path (where the Objs are located, you can use the dropbox folder if you have that locally)
* Output path (where you are going to save these, it needs the actual file structure to exist, so you can copy my dropbox folder. It will overwrite exisiting images. 
* fileNames (the structures + mitotic stages you want to process)
